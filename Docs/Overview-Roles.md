# Gordian Architecture Roles

A variety of roles can be funtionally partitioned within the Gordian Architecture. What follows is a bare listing of some of them:

***Cosigner (aka Signing Device).*** Accepts partially signed or unsigned transactions (typically PSBTs on the Bitcoin network) and signs them, either as part of a single-sig or multisig transaction. This typically means that the _Cosigner_ is also a _Seed Vault_, but this is not required: seeds could be hand-entered or scanned from another source whenever a signature is requested. This role was first demonstrated at Blockchain Commons in [Gordian Cosigner](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianCosigner-iOS) and is now part of the more fully feature [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS). Second-generation wallets, which are airgapped, such as the [Foundation Devices Passport](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md) and the Keystone Pro also support the functionality. 

***Fee Calculator.*** Determines appropriate fees for uses of a blockchain network. There is no Blockchain Commons reference for fee calculation services. Sources such as `bitcoinfees.earn.com` and `mempool.space` provide the service, which is also often supported by a _Network Server_.

***Network Server.*** Talks directly to a cryptocurrency network, accepting inputs of blocks and enabling transmission of new transactions. Typically a full node. De facto, also a _Broadcast Coordinator_, and so the role is not separated out. At Blockchain Commons, this is [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS). In a self-sovereign scenario, a Bitcoin Core or Electrum server could also fulfill the role.

***Policy Coordinator.*** Manages the creation of multisigs. Blockchain Commons' [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) was an early example, but at this point we lean toward [Sparrow](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md) as a more fully featured piece of software.

***Pricing Calculator.*** Determines current values of cryptocurrencies, usually in fiat currencies. Blockchain offers the [Spotbit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) microservice to fulfill this role.

***Seed Generator.*** Creates new seeds. This typically means that the _Seed Generator_ is also a _Seed Vault_, but this is not required: a highly partitioned architecture could separate out the functions for increased security. The prime examples that Blockchain Commons offers for partitioned seed generation are [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit) and [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS). Most hardware and software wallets also support seed generation, but in a non-partitioned way.

***Seed Vault.*** Stores seeds securely. [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) is Blockchain Commons' reference for seed storage. Hardware wallets, both first-generation connected wallets such as Ledger and Trezor and second-generation airgapped wallets such as Keystone and [Passport](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md), also provide the service.

***Share Server.** Stores one share of a sharded secret securely. This is a core element of the [CSR system](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md).

***Transaction Coordinator.*** Creates transactions. Though Blockchain Commons' [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) creates transactions, its role as a transaction coordinator is a bit dated. Instead, we suggest the [Sparrow wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md) as a released software wallet that can act as a transaction coordinator, interacting with a variety of Cosigners and Seed Vaults. (The difference between a "software wallet" and a pure "transaction coordinator", is that a "software wallet" can also hold keys, though proper partitioning moves keys to other devices.) We will soon be replaced Gordian Coordinator as a next generation replacement.
