# The Gordian Architecture

The Gordian architecture is an overall plan for interoperable specifications and design patterns that support the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), ensuring the independence, privacy, resilience, and openness of digital assets. The ultimate goal is to prevent vendor lock-in and to remove the threats of single points of compromise, failure, and denial so that users can personally protect their self-sovereign digital assets without the fear of loss.

_As Above, So Below:_ the Gordian Architecture comes in two parts. At the high level, the _Macro-Architecture_ and specific services such as the _Key Management Services_, are designed and built to fulfill the Gordian Principles. However, in order for the Macro-Architecture to interoperate, its participates must agree on a series of _Encoding Specifications_, the heart of which is the self-describing, self-certifying _UR_ system. Orthogonal to this, _Visual Specifications_ offer additional ways to fulfill the Gordian Principles.

## Macro-Architecture

The Gordian Macro-architecture is built on a design pattern of functional partition.

Rather than following the design pattern of classic services, which group multiple services into singular applications, the Gordian Architecture instead separates both services and confidential data from each other, paritioning them with airgaps and torgaps. Doing so improves privacy and security by reducing the value of honeypots and also improves functional design by ensuring that each application is precisely and concisely able to perform a specific function. Many of the Gordian reference apps are actually microservices, intended to perform small and simple but necessary activities as part of the blockchain ecosystem.

Using functionally partitioned services, linked by airgaps and torgaps to minimize attacks in transit and to improve partitioning, the Gordian architecture creates a powerful and safe new methodology for financial, data, and information operations on the internet. It also creates an ecosystem that allows for the inclusion of multiple developers, each producing their own applications that are all interoperable thanks to usage of Gordian Encoding Specifications. This improves the overall architecture through these competitive designs and ensures survivability of the model as a whole.

* **Service.** A service that fulfills some large-scale need for digital-asset management, most commonly the ability to store private information, create transactions, sign transactions, or send transactions. *Examples:* [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) (signing device), Gordian Coordinator (transaction coordinator).

* **Microservice.** A service that fulfills a small need in the overall Gordian ecosystem such as price lookups. *Examples:* [SpotBit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit).

* **AirGap.** A physical gap between services or microservices, where either side might not even be networked. A service protected by an AirGap communicates through the reading of QR Codes or through transmission of data on MicroSD cards, NFC tags, or other removable media.

* **TorGap.** A link between services or microservices that connect via [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), maximizing their partitioning by ensuring mutual anonymity of the services.

### Key Management Services

Traditionally, digital-asset architectures have focused on multi-function wallets that act as both transaction coordinators and signing devices. Breaking apart these features through the design pattern of functional partition creates a new paradigm that reveals the possibility of many new and different services. The Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) service and the future Collaborative Key Management (CKM) service are two such innovations: they demonstrate how new services can purposefully fulfill the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.

* **Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).** CSR is a service that improves the resilience of seeds and other secrets by using SSKR to distribute shares of the secret to a variety of Share Servers. The goal is to automate the backup and reconstruction of secrets in order to protect the self-sovereign control of digital assets. See [Collaborative Seed Recovery Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md).

* **Collaborative Key Management.** CKM is a future technology that will introduce key-management servers that generate and use secrets without those secrets ever existing prior to their usage. It continues the pattern of resilience introduced by CSR but takes it to the next step by also offering strong protections against not just loss but also compromise.

## Encoding Specifications

The interoperability of the Gordian Macro-Architecture is only made possible if the individual servers speak the same language. That's where Encoding Specifications come into play: they standardize communication, so that current servers can communicate, but also so that future servers can recognize messages (or more importantly: digital assets) archived in the past.

The most common pattern for data encoding in the Gordian Architecture is:

1. Data is encoded in CBOR.
2. CBOR is converted to minimal bytewords.
3. Minimal bytewords are prefixed with a UR type to generate a URI.
4. (Optionally) UR is encoded in a QR code.

* **CBOR.** Concise Binary Object Representation, or CBOR, is a data format that Blockchain Commons has adopted as its lowest level format. It's a stable, concise binary encoding method that allows typing of data. See [CBOR.io](https://cbor.io/) and [RFC 8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html).

* **Bytewords.** Bytewords are a method for encoding binary data as English words, with special care taken to ensure that the words are unique and recognizable. Bytewords can be used to encode any data, allowing users to etch or write out English-language representations of their digital-asset keys, so they're harder to confuse. However, in the Gordian Architecture the most important purpose of Bytewords is to encode binary CBOR as alphabetic characters. This is done with a "minimal" representation of Bytewords, which uses just the first and last letter of each word (e.g., "tuna" becomes "ta", "acid" becomes "ad", etc.). See [BCR-2020-12: Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md).

* **URs.** A UR wraps and tags data that is encoded with CBOR and then translated into minimal Bytewords. In doing so, it ensures that the data is self-describing and self-certifying. This is what enables the interoperability of the Gordian Architecture. URs also include a method for sequencing larger data. See [BCR-2020-05: UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) and [BCR-2020-06: Registry of UR Types](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md). Also see [Introduction: How Are URs Encoded?](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md#how-are-urs-encoded) for the precise process of converting data to CBOR, Bytewords, and ultimately URs, as well as our [UR Docs Overview Page](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md).
 
* **QR Codes.** URS were designed to ensure that they could be efficienctly stored as QR codes. The sequencing design of URs also allows for the creation of animated QRs for larger amounts of data. Though QRs are not required for the Gordian Architecture, they're crucial if Airgaps are introduced into the Macro-Architecture.

### Backup Specifications

UR encoding can be used for all sorts of transmissions between servers. It can also be used to encode data, which helps ensure the Resilience of the Gordian Architecture because the self-describing and self-certifying data can be retrieved by other apps in the future.

* **Keys & Seeds.** Key material can be encoded as `ur:crypto-seed`, `ur:bip39`, and `ur:hdkey`, allowing for the storage of a bare seed, a BIP-39â€“encoded seed, or a derived key. See [BCR-2020-06: Registry of UR Types](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md) for [`crypto-seed`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#cryptographic-seed-crypto-seed) and [`crypto-bip39`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#bip-39-encoded-seed-crypto-bip39) and [BCR-2020-07: UR Type Definition for HD Keys](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-007-hdkey.md) for `crypto-hdkey`. Also see [A Guide to Using URs for Key Material](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md).

* **SSKR.** Shamir's Secret Sharing can be used to ensure that backed-up keys and seeds aren't as susceptible to compromise by sharding the secret and then storing shares separately. The Gordian Architecture enables this through the "SSKR" definition for URs, which allows for the UR-encoding of individual shares. The specific methodology and the C reference library for SSKR have been security reviewed. See [BCR-2020-11: UR Type Definition for SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md) and [SSKR Security Review](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md). Also see [A Guide to Using URs for SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-3-sskrs.md) and our [SSKR Docs Overview Page](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md). In the future, SSKR will be expanded to support other sharding algorithms such as VSS.

### UR Specifications

Though UR can be used to encoded a variety of digital data, there are three specific UR types that are of particular importance because of their ability to further expand the UR spec to support authentication and communication.

* **Crypto-Envelopes.** The crypto-envelope is a container structure for URs that allows data to be encoded and encrypted; through a permit system it then supports decryption via a variety of methods, including SSKR. Prime features include the ability to effectively shard much larger amounts of data than possible through standard SSKR and to create permits that allow data to be decrypted in a variety of ways. It's the foundation of `crypto-request` and a core element of CSR. See [BCSwiftSecureComponents Docs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs).
 
* **Crypto-Request** & **Crypto-Response.** Communication between servers is a crucial element in the Gordian Architecture. The `crypto-request` and `crypto-response` UR types allow one service to request data such a seed or key from another service. This enables true automation, minimizing the need for users to understand the specifics of what's going on (while stile entirely preserving their agency by requiring their confirmation for responses). See [BCR-2021-01: UR Type Definitions for Transactions Between Airgapped Devices](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md). Also see [A Guide to Using UR Request & Response](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-99-request-response.md).

## Visual Specifications

Visual Specifications are intended to improve the usability of digital assets by making it easy for the user to recognize one without having to memorize a long hex code. They can help services in the Gordian Architecture to better fulfill the Gordian Principles by protecting assets (and thus ensuring privacy and resilience).

* **Object Identity Block.** An Object Identity Block (OIB) is a collection of readable data and images which together make it easy to recognize the digital object being described. See [BCR-2021-02: Digests for Digital Objects](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md).

* **Lifehash.** A Lifehash appears as part of an OIB. It's a visual hash of a digital object that is intended to make it possible to recognize an object at a glance thanks to the patterning and coloring. See [Lifehash.info](https://lifehash.info/) and the [Lifehash.info README](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#lifehash-beautiful-visual-hashes).
