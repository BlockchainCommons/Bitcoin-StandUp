# ðŸ›  Gordian Products & Technologies

*(Previously known as Bitcoin Standup and FullyNoded-2)*

The Gordian system is a suite of powerful open-source tools that offers a self-sovereign solution for Bitcoin by using Tor and QuickConnect technology to link a protected GordianServer with a mobile GordianWallet so that you access full-node capabilities from a mobile device. ([It's meant to cut through a traditionally knotty problem in Bitcoin development.](Docs/Why-Gordian.md))

* **GordianWallet** is a mobile wallet special-built as part of the the Gordian system. It was created to support self-sovereign interactions while providing protected communications, and to utilize the newest cutting-edge Bitcoin technology, such as PSBTs and multi-sig addresses, which can multiply the protection of your Bitcoin funds.
* **GordianServer** is an app that uses Bitcoin Standup technology to help users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services. GordianServer will harden and secure your OS to current best practices and will add sufficient system tools to support basic Bitcoin development. It will also eventually support optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), and [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver), as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers. GordianServer is currently available for [MacOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS), with more limited functionality provided for [Linux machines](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts) by Bitcoin Standup.
* **QuickConnect** is an API that generates a QR code (and/or special URI) to link your *GordianServer* to other devices, such as a mobile phone using [GordianWallet](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8) on iOS, a remote desktop, or the [Fully Noded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fully-noded/id1436425586) app on iOS.

## GordianWallet on iOS

[GordianWallet-iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) is a purpose-built remote app for securely connecting to your node over Tor from anywhere in the world. Combined with your *GordianServer*, it provides you with a powerful suite of tools for managing Bitcoin. You can scan the QuickConnect QR code from *GordianServer-macOS* and easily create mutli-sig wallets where one key gets stored on your device, one on your node, and one in offline backup.

*GordianWallet-iOS* is a macCatalyst app and can therefore be used on either iOS devices or macOS.

**[Install for macOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS/blob/master/GordianWallet-macOS.dmg)**

### Other Wallet Options: FullyNoded for iOS

GordianWallet author Peter Denton also provides an alternative app: [FullyNoded-iOS](https://fullynoded.app/), a feature-rich Bitcoin wallet.

## Gordian Server on MacOS

[GordianServer-macOS.app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS) is an app that provides personal one-click installation for Bitcoin Core and Tor. It's built on Bitcoin Standup technology that presents a QuickConnect QR code that can be used to pair mobile wallets for remote use over Tor V3.

*GordianServer-macOS* has been developed and tested on "Mojave" and "Catalina", it can be installed via a DMG or an Xcode compilation

**[Install from DMG](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/blob/master/GordianServer-macOS-v0.1.2.dmg)**

### Other Node Options: Bitcoin Standup for Linux

[Linux Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts) achieves the same thing as GordianServer-macOS, but comes in the form of Linux scripts rather than a central app.

The easiest-to-use version of the Linux scripts run through the StackScript system at Linode, but you can alternatively use Linux scripts that have been tested with Debian Stretch and Ubuntu 18.04.

## Quick Connect for the Gordian system

The Gordian system is built on the [Quick Connect API](Docs/Quick-Connect-API.md), which defines the spec for a deep link URI and a scannable QR Code, and which links your *GordianServer* (or other Bitcoin Standup node) to a *GordianWallet*. Besides being used by *GordianServer-macOS*, it's also supported by several server-side node manufacturers.
