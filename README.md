The Gordian system is all about user agency & security. It's intended to support the self-sovereign control of digital assets in a way that's safe, secure, and private by enabling responsible key management, [cutting through a traditionally knotty problem in Bitcoin development.](Docs/Why-Gordian.md). The Gordian system is built on a foundation of Principles that have been fulfilled in an Architecture that is embodied in Reference Apps and supported by Reference Libraries.

* **Gordian Principles.** A mission statement of four core principles that support self-sovereign control of digital assets.
* **Gordian Architecture.** The design for both the overall architecture and the individual specifications that make it possible.
* **Gordian Reference Apps.** A set of applications that demonstrate the Gordian Architecture, its Principles, its specifications, and its Libraries.
* **Gordian Reference Libraries.** A set of libraries that allow developers to incorporate Gordian specifications and expand the Gordian ecosystem.
* **#SmartCustody.** Educational programs meant to support the Gordian Principles.

The ultimate goal of the Gordian System is to create a community of developers who have followed the examples of the Gordian Reference Apps and used the Gordian Reference Libraries to build their own applications that embody the Gordian Architecture and fulfill the Gordian Principles.

*This repo contains a table of contents for various the Gordian system projects and features. Please see individual repos and pages for more information.*

## Gordian Principles

Blockchain Commons' interoperable specifications are meant to support four core principles that put the user first and that enable responsible key management:

* **Independence.** Gordian improves user freedom from involuntary oversight or external control.
* **Privacy.** Gordian protects against coercion with non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** Gordian protects users to decrease the likelihood of them losing their funds via any means.
* **Openness.** Gordian supports open infrastructure that allows developers to create their own applications.

Look at individual Blockchain Commons reference apps for guidance on how each acts as a model for these principles and [#SmartCustody Case Studies](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Studies-Overview.md) for how professional hardware & software apps do so.

## Gordian Architecture

The Gordian Architecture puts the Gordian Principles into use through an overall design that covers everything that from the high-level architecture of a Gordian ecosystem through the specification and UX best practices that make it possible.

* **Gordian Macro-Architecture.** The ecosystem architecture depends on functional partition, separating services and confidential data.
* **Data Format.** CBOR is used as the canonical data structure for the Gordian Architecture.
* **Encoding Specifications.** Bytewords, URs, and (optionally) QR Codes ensure that Gordian services are interoperable.
* **Backup Specifications.** UR specifications make it easy to backup confidential data, creating Resilience.
* **Communication Specifications.** Further UR specifications such as envelopes and request/responses aid interoperable communication.
* **Secure UX Designs.** UX best practices form another layer of support for the Gordian Principles.

Please see [The Gordian Architecture](/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md) for more in-depth discussion of all the architectural elements and [Gordian Architecture Roles](/Docs/Overview-Roles.md) for examples of functions that can be partitioned within the Macro-architecture. Also see [Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md) for our largest current architectual project in 2022 and [Collaborative Key Management (CKM) Overview](Docs/CKM.md) for our planned next step in 2023-2024.

Together, these elements (in particular: a network coordinator such as Gordian Coordinator; a signing device such as Gordian Seed Tool; encoding specifications such URs; and communication specifications such as envelope, request, and response) comprise what we consider a Minimal Viable Architecture (MVA) for Gordian, and thus for safe, self-sovereign architecture. They're the minimum that's needed to properly support users.

## Gordian Reference Apps

Gordian Reference Apps demonstrate the elements of how the Gordian Architecture and how they can be used to fulfill the Gordian Principles. Our Gordian Reference Apps undergoing the most development currently include:

* **Gordian Coordinator.** A Networked transaction coordinator.
* **Gordian Seed Tool.** An Airgapped seed vault & signing device.
* **SpotBit.** A Micro-pricing service.

Please see [The Gordian Reference Apps](/Docs/Overview-Apps.md) for a complete list of past and present reference apps, links to their repos, and an example of how they can be combined into a Macro-Architecture. Links to CLI apps are also included.

## Gordian Reference Libraries

The Gordian Reference Libraries allow you to easily use many of the specifications that lay the foundation for the Gordian Architecture. Our foundational libraries are usually written in C or C++, but many have many converted in other languages such as Java, Python, and Swift.

The core libraries are:

* **bc-bytewords.** A library for encoding binary data into Bytewords.
* **bc-lifehash.** A library for creating Lifehash visual hashes.
* **bc-sskr.** A library for sharding a secret and converting it to Bytewords or URs.
* **bc-ur.** A library for encoding binrary data as URs.

Please see [The Gordian Reference Libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons#gordian-reference-libraries) for a complete list of libraries in a variety of languages.
