# ðŸ›  Bitcoin-Standup

*Bitcoin-Standup* is a open source project and a suite of tools that helps users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services. It will eventually also support optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), and [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver) as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers. *Bitcoin-Standup* strives to provide the community with an easy to use "one-click" set up full-node complete with a purpose built remote app for securely connecting to your node over Tor from anywhere in the world, providing you with a powerful suite of tools.

This tool will also harden and secure your OS to current best practices and will add sufficient system tools to support basic Bitcoin development. After setup, *Bitcoin-Standup* will present a QR code and/or special URI that can be used to securely link your full-node to other devices, such as a remote desktop or a mobile phone using [FullyNoded 2](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8) or [Fully Noded 1](https://github.com/FontaineDenton/iOS/FullyNoded) on iOS.

This repo contains a table of contents for various *Standup* projects and features. Please see individual repos and pages for more information.

## MacOs Standup

[MacOS StandUp.app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-MacOS) is a personal one-click installer for Bitcoin Core and Tor that will present a QuickConnect QR code that can be used to pair mobile wallets for remote use over Tor V3.

*MacOS Standup* has been developed and tested on "Mojave" and "Catalina", it can be installed via a DMG or an Xcode compilation

## Linux Standup

[Linux Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts) achieve the same thing as MacOS StandUp, but come in the form of Linux scripts.

The easiest-to-use Linux scripts run through the StackScript system at Linode, but you can alternatively use Linux scripts that have been tested with Debian Stretch and Ubuntu 18.04.

## Quick Connect

[Quick Connect API](Docs/Quick-Connect-API.md) defines the spec for a deep link URI and a scannable QR Code. It is used by *Bitcoin-Standup* as well as by several server-side node manufacturers.

### Related Projects

The full node created by *Bitcoin-Standup* can also be interlinked with other projects from Blockchain Commons.

1. [iOS FullyNoded 2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2) is a state-of-the-art mobile wallet that was made to work with a *Bitcoin-Standup* full node.  You can scan the QuickConnect QR code from *Bitcoin-Standup* and easily create mutli-sig wallets where one key gets stored on your device, one on your node, and one in offline backup.
2. [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) is a tutorial for programming the `bitcoin-cli`, which can be run using a full node such as the one created by *Bitcoin-Standup*.
