The Gordian system is all about user agency & security. It's intended to support the self-sovereign control of digital assets in a way that's safe, secure, and private by enabling responsible key management, [cutting through a traditionally knotty problem in Bitcoin development.](Docs/Why-Gordian.md). The Gordian system is built on a foundation of Principles that have been fulfilled in an Architecture that is embodied in Reference Apps and supported by Reference Libraries.

* **Gordian Principles.** A mission statement of four core principles that support self-sovereign control of digital assets.
* **Gordian Architecture.** The design for both the overall architecture and the individual specifications that make it possible.
* **Gordian Reference Apps.** A set of applications that demonstrate the Gordian Architecture, its Principles, its specifications, and its Libraries.
* **Gordian Reference Libraries.** A set of libraries that allow developers to incorporate Gordian specifications and expand the Gordian ecosystem.

The ultimate goal of the Gordian System is to create a community of developers who have followed the examples of the Gordian Reference Apps and used the Gordian Reference Libraries to build their own applications that embody the GOrdian Architecture and fulfill the Gordian Principles.

*This repo contains a table of contents for various the Gordian system projects and features. Please see individual repos and pages for more information.*

## Gordian Principles

Blockchain Commons' interoperable specifications are meant to support four core principles that put the user first and that enable responsible key management:

* **Independence.** Gordian improves user freedom from involuntary oversight or external control.
* **Privacy.** Gordian protects against coercion with non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** Gordian protects users to decrease the likelihood of them losing their funds via any means.
* **Openness.** Gordian supports open infrastructure that allows developers to create their own applications.

Look at individual Blockchain Commons reference apps for guidance on how each acts as a model for these principles and [#SmartCustody Case Studies](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Studies-Overview.md) for how professional hardware & software apps do so.

## Gordian Architecture

The Gordian Architecture puts the Gordian Principles into use through an overall design that covers everything that from the high-level architecture of a Gordian ecosystem through the specification and UX best practices that make it possible.

* **Gordian Macro-Architecture.** The ecosystem architecture depends on functional partition, separating services and confidential data.
* **Data Format.** CBOR is used as the canonical data structure for the Gordian Architecture.
* **Encoding Specifications.** Bytewords, URs, and (optionally) QR Codes ensure that Gordian services are interoperable.
* **Backup Specifications.** UR specifications make it easy to backup confidential data, creating Resilience.
* **Communication Specifications.** Further UR specifications such as envelopes and request/responses aid interoperable communication.
* **Secure UX Designs.** UX best practices form another layer of support for the Gordian Principles.

Please see [The Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md) for more in-depth discussion of all the architectural elements.

## Gordian Reference Apps

Gordian Reference Apps demonstrate the elements of how the Gordian Architecture and how they can be used to fulfill the Gordian Principles. Our Gordian Reference Apps undergoing the most development currently include:

* **Gordian Coordinator.** A Networked transaction coordinator.
* **Gordian Seed Tool.** An Airgapped seed vault & signing device.
* **SpotBit.** A Micro-pricing service.

Please see [The Gordian Reference Apps](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/shannona-gordian-revision/Docs/Overview-Apps.md) for a complete list of past and present reference apps, links to their repos, and an example of how they can be combined into a Macro-Architecture.

## Gordian Reference Libraries


## Quick Links for Reference Apps

Blockchain Commons has released a number of apps to exemplify the deployment of Gordian Principles

### Mobile Apps

Our two most advanced reference apps are both available from the Apple App Store for Macs or iOS devices:

* [GordianSeedTool-iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS)
   * [Download from Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229)

We also have released two additional mobile apps, which demonstrate Gordian principles, but which have not been advanced to full release:

* GordianCosigner
   * [GordianCosigner-Android](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android)
   * [GordianCosigner-catalyst (iOS)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst)
   * [GordianCosigner-MacOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS)
* [GordianWallet-iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)

### CLI Apps

Many of our CLI apps were built to exercise our [crypto-commons libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons) but they also serve as references for the Gordian Principles, the UNIX/command-line equivalent of some of our mobile apps.

* **[Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords-cli) \(CLI\).** A tool for testing bytewords.
* **[Keytool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli) \(CLI\).** A tool for deriving keys and addresses from seeds. 
* **[LifeHashTool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool) \(Swift CLI\).** A tool for generating Lifehash PNGs from the command line.
* **[Mori](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli) \(CLI\).** A timelock tool to make sure your assets aren't lost.
* **[Musign](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli) \(CLI\).** A research project for signing and verifying messages with ECDSA and Schnorr.
* **[Seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) \(Rust CLI\).** A tool for generating seeds from a variety of random inputs and for translating seeds among formats.
* **[Sweeptool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli) \(Rust CLI\).**  A tool for moving funds out of a descriptor wallet.

### Server Apps

Ultimately, Bitcoin apps require a Bitcoin server. The Gordian Server demonstrates how to set one up and abide by the Gordian Principles, particularly independence and privacy.

* [GordianServer-macOS.app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS)
   * [Install from DMG](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases)
   * [Linux Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts)

### Web Microservices

Web microservices are meant to support mobile or CLI apps by providing specific, small-scale services, such as price-lookups.

* [SpotBit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit)

### Hardware Apps

We've also produced one DIY hardware app that you can build to demonstrate the Gordian Principles.

* [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit)

## Quick Links for #SmartCustody Articles

Please see the [SmartCustody repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody) for articles on Multisigs, Timelocks, and other SmartCustody topics.


### Gordian Architecture Roles

Roles that can be funtionally partitioned include:

***Cosigner.*** Accepts partially signed or unsigned transactions (typically PSBTs on the Bitcoin network) and signs them, either as part of a single-sig or multisig transaction. This typically means that the _Cosigner_ is also a _Seed Vault_, but this is not required: seeds could be hand-entered or scanned from another source whenever a signature is requested. This role was first demonstrated at Blockchain Commons in [Gordian Cosigner](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianCosigner-iOS) and is now part of the more fully feature [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS). Second-generation wallets, which are airgapped, such as the [Foundation Devices Passport](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md) and the Keystone Pro also support the functionality. 

***Fee Calculator.*** Determines appropriate fees for uses of a blockchain network. There is no Blockchain Commons reference for fee calculation services. Sources such as `bitcoinfees.earn.com` and `mempool.space` provide the service, which is also often supported by a _Network Server_.

***Network Server.*** Talks directly to a cryptocurrency network, accepting inputs of blocks and enabling transmission of new transactions. Typically a full node. De facto, also a _Broadcast Coordinator_, and so the role is not separated out. At Blockchain Commons, this is [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS). In a self-sovereign scenario, a Bitcoin Core or Electrum server could also fulfill the role.

***Policy Coordinator.*** Manages the creation of multisigs. Blockchain Commons' [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) was an early example, but at this point we lean toward [Sparrow](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md) as a more fully featured piece of software.

***Pricing Calculator.*** Determines current values of cryptocurrencies, usually in fiat currencies. Blockchain offers the [Spotbit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit) microservice to fulfill this role.

***Seed Generator.*** Creates new seeds. This typically means that the _Seed Generator_ is also a _Seed Vault_, but this is not required: a highly partitioned architecture could separate out the functions for increased security. The prime examples that Blockchain Commons offers for partitioned seed generation are [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit) and [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS). Most hardware and software wallets also support seed generation, but in a non-partitioned way.

***Seed Vault.*** Stores seeds securely. [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) is Blockchain Commons' reference for seed storage. Hardware wallets, both first-generation connected wallets such as Ledger and Trezor and second-generation airgapped wallets such as Keystone and [Passport](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md), also provide the service.

***Transaction Coordinator.*** Creates transactions. Though Blockchain Commons' [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS) creates transactions, its role as a transaction coordinator is a bit dated. Instead, we suggest the [Sparrow wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md) as a released software wallet that can act as a transaction coordinator, interacting with a variety of Cosigners and Seed Vaults. (The difference between a "software wallet" and a pure "transaction coordinator", is that a "software wallet" can also hold keys, though proper partitioning moves keys to other devices.)

### Enabling the Gordian Principles with the Gordian Architecture

As a reference architecture, the Gordian Architecture also demonstrates the Gordian Principles.

* **Independence.** Users can choose which applications to use within an open ecosystem.
* **Privacy.** Airgaps create strong data protection, while torgaps do the same for networked interactions.
* **Resilience.** The paritioned design minimizes Single Points of Compromise.
* **Openness.** Airgaps and torgaps are connected via standard specifications such as URs, which allow anyone to add apps to the ecosystem.



## Overview: Gordian Specifications

The Gordian system of course uses standard protocols for Bitcoin, to interact with the trustless network. Blockchain Commons has also developed specifications of its own and expanded those created for other technology categories, to better fulfill the Gordian Principles. These specifications are demonstrated in many of the Blockchain Commons reference apps, to show how they can be used to full Gordian's requirements for Independent, Privacy, Resilience, and Openness. 

***[Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md).*** Blockchain Commons developed its own binary-to-text format because of flaws in current ones, such as the variants that exist for base-64, and the fact that none of them convert efficiently to the QR codes used widely in Bitcoin applications. Bytewords stay within the 31 characters that are well supported by QR codes (that's letters plus numbers minus URL-breaking characters), allowing more efficient and safe usage.

***[CBOR](https://cbor.io/).*** Blockchain Commons represents binary data as CBOR, or Concise Binary Object Representation, which is RFC 7049. We feel that this self-descriptive language overcomes some of the flaws in pure JSON, while still retaining solid compatibility.

***[LifeHash](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme).*** A visual hashing algorithm that allows users to recognize seeds and other digital data by sight.

***[Quick Connect API](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Quick-Connect-API.md).*** A spec for a deep link URI and a scannable QR Code, used to connect a wallet and server across a gap.

***[SSKR](9https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr).*** A replacement for SLIP-39 to resolve issues where SLIP-39 and BIP-39 do not round-trip.

***[URs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).*** The objective of many of our protocol expansions was to create a more robust system for encoding PSBTs, which were otherwise limited by the maximimum size of QR codes and the inefficient ways in which current text formats interacted with them. Much of that comes together in our Uniform Resource (UR) encoding, which is built upon Byteword and CBOR structures. It creates a methodology for encoding PSBTs as QR codes, either using sequential or animated QRs.

Please see the [Airgapped Wallet repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community), especially its [discussions](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions), for more on our work with the community to advance wallet state of the art.

## Overview: Gordian Crypto Commons

To further support Gordian's principles and best practices, Blockchain Commons has created a number of Gordian reference libraries, which embody our specifications, as well as reference apps and command-line programs. 

These are fully described in the [Crypto Commons Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md).

Blockchain Commons is also happy to use libraries from other sources, if they're stabled and well-supported.

## Spotlight: Gordian SeedTool on iOS (and macOS)

**Roles:** Cosigner, Seed Generator, Seed Vault

[Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) for iOS And MacOS is Blockchain Commons' most sophisticated reference tool for demonstrating the usage of Blockchain Commons specifications and the Gordian principles.

Gordian SeedTool:

* Allows the storage of seeds in a protected, closely held device.
* Derives Keys that can be sent to other devices.
* Signs PSBTs for seeds that it holds.
* Answers `crypto-requests` with `crypto-responses`.
* Demonstrates other UR, SSKR, ByteWord, and LifeHash functionality.

## Spotlight: Gordian Server on MacOS

**Roles:** Cosigner, Network Server, Seed Generator, Seed Vault (partial)<br>
**#SmartCustody** [Case Study](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-SeedTool.md)

[GordianServer-macOS.app](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS) provides personal one-click installation for Bitcoin Core and Tor. It's built on Bitcoin Standup technology that presents a QuickConnect QR code that can be used to pair mobile wallets for remote use over Tor V3. If you want to have your own, independent and self-sovereign Bitcoin node, this is all you need. [Linux Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-StandUp-Scripts) achieves the same thing as GordianServer-macOS, but comes in the form of Linux scripts rather than a central app.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/master/Images/logos/gordian-server-screen.jpg)

*GordianServer-macOS* has been developed for Macs using Catalina or better; it can be installed via a DMG or an Xcode compilation

* **[Install from DMG](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases).**
